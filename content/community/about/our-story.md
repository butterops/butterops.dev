`ButterOps Dev Community` is a free and open organization headquartered in Bengaluru, India. I [@mrdotkg](https://www.github.com/mrdotkg), brought this multi disciplinary software team together in early 2020. Our founding team includes experts in Product / SaaS Development.

Today, we empower digital literacy among software developers with open-source tools and services.
