## Disclaimer!

ButterOps promotes the expanded impact of investments in technology by maintaining a commitment to the creation of high-quality, open-source digital tools. This is intended to reinforce a digital toolâ€™s original purpose to support a public good, as well as facilitate its future adaptation or reuse in additional contexts beyond, thus transferring valuable knowledge from one experience to another.

It is often thought that open-source is what developers do in their free time. On the contrary, this playbook is an attempt to setup serious busuiness based on open source tools and procedures.
